  # configuration.

  #    for system administrators who are trying to figure out the cause
  #    of a problem.
  #
  # 2: Show more debugging information. This is typically only useful for
  #    developers.
  # 3: Show even more debugging information.
  #

  # configuration option allows one to specify which user Rails/Rack
  # applications must run as, if user switching fails or is disabled.
  #
  # This option may only occur once, in the global server configuration.
  #
  # The default value is nobody.
